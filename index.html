            <h2>What is a Temporary Email Service?</h2>
            <p>A temporary email service, often referred to as a disposable/ throwaway email address offers a email you can use for some specific time. As soon as it is out-of-hand, it is useless. These are the transient addresses, which are valid for only specific time (around 10 min to max of an hour). So these temporary email services help in receiving messages but do not disclose your personal or actual email address thereby stopping spam and junk mails. </p>
